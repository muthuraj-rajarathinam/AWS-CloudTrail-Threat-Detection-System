# 🚨 AWS CloudTrail Threat Detection System

A fully serverless security monitoring solution that detects suspicious activities in your AWS environment using CloudTrail, CloudWatch, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and SNS. Automatically sends real-time email alerts for potential threats and stores incidents for auditing.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This system monitors AWS account activities in real-time and detects:

* Suspicious logins from other regions (China, Russia).
* Usage of AWS root account.
* Other customizable suspicious activities.

When a threat is detected:

* The incident is stored in DynamoDB.
* An email alert is sent via Amazon SNS.

## 📧 SNS Topic – `SecurityAlerts`

* Sends real-time email alerts for each detected threat.
* Subscription required (confirmation email must be accepted).

---

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions (Step-by-Step)

### 1️⃣ Create DynamoDB Table

* Go to **AWS Console** → **DynamoDB** → **Tables** → **Create Table**.
* Table name: `SecurityIncidents`.
* Partition key: `eventTime` (Type: String).
* Click **Create**.

---

### 2️⃣ Create SNS Topic (Email Alerts)

* Go to **SNS** → **Topics** → **Create Topic**.
* Type: **Standard**.
* Name: `SecurityAlerts`.
* Click **Create**.
* Inside the topic:
  * Click **Create Subscription**.
  * Protocol: **Email**.
  * Endpoint: Your email address.
  * Confirm the subscription via your email inbox.

---

### 3️⃣ Deploy Lambda Function (`ThreatAnalyzer`)

* Go to **AWS Lambda** → **Create Function**.
* Author from scratch:
  * Name: `ThreatAnalyzer`.
  * Runtime: Python 3.12+.
* Paste the Lambda code and set:
  * `SecurityIncidents` as DynamoDB Table.
  * SNS Topic ARN from your topic.
* Deploy the function.

---

### 4️⃣ Assign Lambda Permissions

* In Lambda → **Configuration** → **Permissions**.
* Open the execution role.
* Attach:
  * `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess`
  * `AmazonSNSFullAccess`
  * `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`

---

### 5️⃣ Configure CloudTrail Log Group

* Go to **CloudTrail**:
  * Ensure your account has an active Trail.
  * Logs must be forwarded to **CloudWatch Logs**.
* Note the Log Group (e.g., `/aws/cloudtrail/logs`).

---

### 6️⃣ Create Subscription Filter (CloudWatch to Lambda)

* Go to **CloudWatch** → **Logs** → **Log Groups**.
* Select your CloudTrail Log Group.
* Go to **Subscription Filters** → **Create**.
* Destination: **Lambda Function** (`ThreatAnalyzer`).
* Filter Pattern: (leave blank to capture all logs).
* Create the filter.

---

### 7️⃣ Testing & Monitoring

* Trigger AWS activity (logins, API calls, etc.).
* Lambda will auto-trigger upon new CloudTrail logs.
* Check:
  * **CloudWatch Logs** (Lambda function).
  * **DynamoDB** (`SecurityIncidents` table).
  * **SNS Email Alerts**.
